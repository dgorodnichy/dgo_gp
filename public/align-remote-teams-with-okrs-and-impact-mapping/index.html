        <p>In today&rsquo;s fast-paced business environment, remote distributed teams are becoming increasingly common, especially among pre-seed startups.</p>
<p>However, managing projects and coordinating business analysis workshops with limited resources can be challenging.</p>
<p>The lack of a full-time project manager and the absence of real-time feedback from product sponsors often hinder development.</p>
<p>To address these issues and support a cross-functional team with limited experience working with stakeholders, implementing a minimal cadence with <strong>OKRs</strong> and <strong>Impact Mapping</strong> can be the key to success.</p>
<h2 id="align-the-focus-with-okr">Align the Focus with OKR:</h2>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qngq16x6knfyaqm50zem.png" alt="Darts in the goal"></p>
<p>The first step is to gain clarity on the team&rsquo;s most essential goals.</p>
<p>This involves engaging with all stakeholders, including developers, to identify the most expected key results for the next period.</p>
<p><strong>OKRs</strong> (Objectives and Key Results) provide an excellent framework for this purpose.</p>
<p>There are various OKR planning workshops available online, such as those provided by <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr">Atlassian</a> and <a href="https://mooncamp.com/blog/okr-workshop/">Mooncamp</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Prioritize goals that contribute to the survival and revenue generation of the product. Ask several &ldquo;why?&rdquo; until you find <strong>$$$</strong></em></p>
<p>If certain goals seem too ambitious, <strong>consider breaking them down into achievable milestones</strong>. This not only allows for faster feedback but also motivates the team with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<h2 id="kick-off-solutions-with-impact-mapping">Kick-off Solutions with Impact Mapping:</h2>
<p>Once the goals are set, the next step is to brainstorm features and solutions that align with those goals.
Impact Mapping is a valuable technique for this purpose.</p>
<p>It requires addressing four simple questions to start aligning solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why</strong>: Understand the objective and desired outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Who</strong>: Identify the actors or stakeholders involved.</li>
<li><strong>How</strong>: Determine the impact each stakeholder can make.</li>
<li><strong>What</strong>: Define the actions or features needed to achieve the desired outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The best part is that you don&rsquo;t need an expert facilitator to support this workshop, making it easy to implement even with a small remote team.</em></p>
<h2 id="result">Result:</h2>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/le8apwmvn71mvkotayq9.png" alt="Success Team"></p>
<p>With a laser-focused approach based on OKRs and a well-defined roadmap using Impact Mapping, the team can confidently start working on the project.</p>
<p>The advantage of this approach is that it reduces the dependency on real-time communication with product owners or sponsors.</p>
<p>The team can discuss and explore workarounds based on the clear objectives and roadmap, leading to increased productivity and efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>In conclusion, for pre-seed startups with limited resources and remote distributed teams, implementing a minimal cadence with OKRs and Impact Mapping can significantly enhance productivity and streamline the development process.</p>
<p>By starting with laser focus, setting achievable goals, and aligning solutions with Impact Mapping, teams can overcome challenges and achieve success even with limited experience in stakeholder collaboration.</p>
<p>Embracing these techniques will not only lead to a more efficient development process but also foster a strong sense of ownership and motivation within the team.</p>
<p>So, why not give it a try and witness the positive impact on your startup&rsquo;s growth?</p>
